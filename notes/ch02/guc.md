# GUC - Grand Unified Conf

- GUC 的递推起效范围
    - 默认值 ～ 环境变量 ～ 配置文件 ～ postmaster 命令行 ～ 安装时制定 ～ 用户指定 ～ 客户连接请求中的数据包制定 ～ 特定情况下强制设定为默认值 ～ 交互式与非交互式的分割 ～ SET 命令设置

```C
/*
 * Certain options can only be set at certain times. The rules are
 * like this:
 *
 * INTERNAL options cannot be set by the user at all, but only through
 * internal processes ("server_version" is an example).  These are GUC
 * variables only so they can be shown by SHOW, etc.
 *
 * POSTMASTER options can only be set when the postmaster starts,
 * either from the configuration file or the command line.
 *
 * SIGHUP options can only be set at postmaster startup or by changing
 * the configuration file and sending the HUP signal to the postmaster
 * or a backend process. (Notice that the signal receipt will not be
 * evaluated immediately. The postmaster and the backend check it at a
 * certain point in their main loop. It's safer to wait than to read a
 * file asynchronously.)
 *
 * BACKEND options can only be set at postmaster startup, from the
 * configuration file, or by client request in the connection startup
 * packet (e.g., from libpq's PGOPTIONS variable).  Furthermore, an
 * already-started backend will ignore changes to such an option in the
 * configuration file.	The idea is that these options are fixed for a
 * given backend once it's started, but they can vary across backends.
 *
 * SUSET options can be set at postmaster startup, with the SIGHUP
 * mechanism, or from SQL if you're a superuser.
 *
 * USERSET options can be set by anyone any time.

 * The following type records the source of the current setting.  A
 * new setting can only take effect if the previous setting had the
 * same or lower level.  (E.g, changing the config file doesn't
 * override the postmaster command line.)  Tracking the source allows us
 * to process sources in any convenient order without affecting results.
 * Sources <= PGC_S_OVERRIDE will set the default used by RESET, as well
 * as the current value.  Note that source == PGC_S_OVERRIDE should be
 * used when setting a PGC_INTERNAL option.
 *
 * PGC_S_INTERACTIVE isn't actually a source value, but is the
 * dividing line between "interactive" and "non-interactive" sources for
 * error reporting purposes.
 *
 * PGC_S_TEST is used when testing values to be stored as per-database or
 * per-user defaults ("doit" will always be false, so this never gets stored
 * as the actual source of any value).	This is an interactive case, but
 * it needs its own source value because some assign hooks need to make
 * different validity checks in this case.

SHOW ALL;
```

- GUC record struct:

 * applications may use the long description as well, and will append
 * it to the short description. (separated by a newline or '. ')
